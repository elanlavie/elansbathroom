[Click here to check out the website!](https://elansbathroom.onrender.com/) (Note that if it hasn't been used recently, it will take a minute to load--you may need to wait and/or click refresh)

This is a website for my students to get into line for the bathroom and check back in when they get back, saving everyone the headache of trying to remember "who's next?"
The website was mostly vibe-coded using Windsurf!
